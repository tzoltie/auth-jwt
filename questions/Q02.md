## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

Base64 is a encoding function that takes the JSON object, translates it into binary, then returns the binary as a collection of numbers and characters, totalling 64. By turning the JSON into a 64 characters/numbers it condenses it as much as possible when sending as a JWT.
